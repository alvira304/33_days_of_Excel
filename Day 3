Converting to text
TEXT()
Syntax:
=TEXT(value, format_text)
value - The number to convert.
format_text - The number format to use.
- The Excel TEXT function returns a number in a given number format, as text. You can use the TEXT function to embed formatted numbers inside text.
- The input to TEXT must be a numeric value. The output from TEXT is always a text string.
- format_text must appear in double quotation marks.
Examples:
=TEXT(A1,"dd-mmm-yy") // date like "15-Oct-19"
=TEXT(A1,"0%") // percent like "25%"
="You won "&TEXT(A1,"$0") // "You won $100"

Converting to numbers
VALUE() 
Syntax:
=VALUE(text)
text - the text value to convert to a number.
- The Excel VALUE function converts text that appears in a recognized format (i.e. a number, date, or time format) into a numeric value.
- Normally, Excel automatically converts text to numeric values as needed, so the VALUE function is not needed.
- Microsoft states that the VALUE function is provided for compatibility with other spreadsheet programs.

Rounding numbers
ROUND()
=ROUND (number, num_digits)
number - The number to round.
num_digits - The number of digits to which number should be rounded.
- The Excel ROUND function returns a number rounded to a given number of digits. The ROUND function can round to the right or left of the decimal point.
- Round a number to a given number of digits

ROUND() with VALUE()
Syntax:
=ROUND(VALUE(text),decimal places)
